# emoji-everywhere
Browser extension for automatically converting slack/messenger like key patterns to emojis

User story:
- User types `:laughing:` somewhere on a site
- Extension automatically replaces it with ðŸ˜†.


## Motivation:
Emoji is such a good way to express emotion. However, inserting emoji is still such a pain in most websites. Following is a list of famous websites and the pain one needs to go through for inserting a lousy emoji:


- **Google Slides (Google docs as well)**: Go to Insert>Special Characters. Search for emoji (its highly unlikely to find the emoji you want)

- **LinkedIn**: No native way to insert emoji (you need to copy paste an emoji from somewhere to insert emojis)

- 


## Requesting Contributions:

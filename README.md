# emoji-everywhere
Browser extension for automatically converting slack/messenger like key patterns to emojis

User story:
- User types `:laughing:` somewhere on a site
- Extension automatically replaces it with ðŸ˜†.

## Requesting Contributions:
- LMK (email: sa3762@columbia.edu) if you are interested in this idea.
- I am pretty busy right now but can provide some guidance on development (have [some experience with chrome extensions](https://github.com/PornBlock/PornBlock))
- If you make serious progress, you can own the idea and the repository. I can be the second collaborator and will be just happy to see the idea in action.
